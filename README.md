# cli-gopher-rpg
The final excercise 6-08 from the repository "learn-programming-with-go-excercises" 

The task is to create a turn-based CLI RPG where the player may take some actions with the goal of defeating the opponent. 

## Usage: 
Simply type the action (attack/buy/work/train) you wish to take on that turn. 
+ Attack deals an amount within your weapon's damage range to the opponent
+ Buy allows you to buy a weapon and equip it, or a consumable to restore an amount of health.
+ Work earns the player between 5 - 15 gold
+ Train increases the chosen attribute by 1 (allowing them meet min requirements for equipping more advanced weapons)
+ Exit exits the game.
